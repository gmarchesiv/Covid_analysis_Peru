## Cases per million vs deaths per million @ 07-31-2021

The data in this folder can help analyze the discrepancy between cases per million and deaths per million for the case of Peru. 
A univariate linear regression shows that the deaths would correspond to 5X cases per million. 
Though the R2 is low (0.51) it does shed some light on if Peru is really such an outlier as the graphs show. 
Low testing capacity, especially at the beginning of the pandemic could be at the heart of the discrepancy.
