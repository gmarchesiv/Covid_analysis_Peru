title: 1.	What is the real number of Covid cases in Peru? Is Peru already protected from the Delta variant?

*First published on August 2, 2021*

Peru is out of alignment with the world in the number of deaths per million inhabitants. A linear regression analysis using the number of cases per million inhabitant as an explanatory variable shows it graphically. The equation predicts for Peru a value of 1,164 deaths per million inhabitants, when the reported figure is 5,869, that is, a 5X multiplier.

Likewise, after Yemen, Peru is the country with the highest death rate per reported case (9.3%). The world average is 2.1%, that is a multiplier of 4.4x.

MINSA corrected the number of deaths using SINADEF data. However, it could not do the same with the number of cases, since the number of Covid tests necessary to have a more accurate data at the time were not carried out when they should have. 

Based on these two figures, its plausible that the real number of cases would be in a range between 4 to 5 times that reported, that is, between 8.5 and 10.6 million.

Unlike what has been happening in the northern hemisphere, Peru has seen declining number of infections for a month and a half. So far, the delta variant has not had the impact seen around the world. In part it is because the masking mandate is still in place. But, in addition, I would propose the hypothesis that between 26% and 32% of the population has already generated antibodies due to exposure to the virus, which slows its propagation.

Consider that the percentage of vaccinated is still at low levels (16% of the total population). Given that the data between the two groups cannot be crossed at the national ID level, we do not know how many vaccinated people have been infected by the virus. However, the proposed calculations show us that the minimum point of the range could be 26% (if all those vaccinated had previous exposure) and the maximum point could be 48% (if no vaccinated had previous exposure). Taking the midpoint, 37%, we would have already passed the halfway point to herd immunity, ~ 70%.

In July, 1.94 million Peruvians were vaccinated with two doses. If this step is continued (6% of the population per month), we would be reaching herd immunity in January 2022. Since we still do not have clear information on the level of defense of those previously exposed against the delta, it is reasonable maintain the mask-wearing mandate and continue (if not accelerate) the vaccination process. Thus, we may be thinking of a really different New Year. Let's continue calmly and with faith.
